# Algorithms

A small collection of the labs from my algorithms course written in Python!

## Lab 1

Lab 1 is an investigation into the Collatz conjecture, a notorious unsolved problem in mathematics.  Start with an positive integer n, the next term is generated as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term.  If it was odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.  The question is this: does the Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive inter initial values?

## Lab 2

Lab 2 looks at a divide & conquer style algorithm that deals with finding the max subarray of an array.  It finds the largest some of any consecutive array values (where array values can be any integer +/-).

## Lab 3

Lab 3 studied the generation of convex hulls of sets of points in 2 dimensions.  The quickhull algorithm was used due to its relatively low complexity.

## Lab 4

Lab 4 looked at using a greedy algorithm to determine the number of gates needed at an airport terminal based on arrival and departure times of airplanes.
